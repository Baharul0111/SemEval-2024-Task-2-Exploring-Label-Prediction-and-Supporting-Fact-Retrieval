The intra-patient difference in hot flash activity between baseline (study week 1) and treatment termination (study week 7) is the primary endpoint. The hot flash activity will be measured by the weekly average hot flash score which is a composite entity of both frequency and severity of hot flashes.   The hot flash severities are graded from 1 to 4, ranging from mild, to moderate, to severe to very severe. The daily hot flash score is computed by multiplying the mean grade of severity by the frequency during every 24 hour period. Therefore, a score of zero is the lowest possible score and can be interpreted as having no hot flashes.

The intra-patient difference in hot flash activity between baseline (study week 1) and treatment termination (study week 7) is the primary endpoint. The hot flash activity will be measured by the weekly average hot flash score which is a composite entity of both frequency and severity of hot flashes.   The hot flash severities are graded from 1 to 4, ranging from mild, to moderate, to severe to very severe. The daily hot flash score is computed by multiplying the mean grade of severity by the frequency during every 24 hour period. Therefore, a score of zero is the lowest possible score and can be interpreted as having no hot flashes. The average daily hot flash score during the baseline week was compared to the average daily value during week 7.

The non-inferiority analyses were performed by comparing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the two algorithms & to compare false positive marks per subject.   The ROC curve incorporates both sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) providing a single assessment incorporating both measures. It shows in a graphical way the trade-off between clinical sensitivity and specificity for every possible cut-off for a test, and gives an idea about the benefit of using the test in question. The higher the total area under the curve, the greater the predictive power of the reader assessments.   A breast-based analysis was used for the primary AUC comparison in order to obtain additional power by having more normal/benign breasts.   Time frame: ~1 year. Women with negative or biopsy benign findings at baseline (study entry) were followed for 1 year to confirm the negative status at 1-year follow-up mammography exam. Women diagnosed with cancer were not followed up.

Where the disease was restricted to a solitary lesion, the neoplastic nature of the lesion should have been confirmed by cytology or histology.   Documented amplification of ErbB2 3+ by immunohistochemistry or a positive score (>2.2) by FISH using a local laboratory result (which was considered sufficient in this study with no further verification by a central laboratory).   Subjects must have received no more than one prior chemotherapeutic regimen in the metastatic setting.   If a taxane had been administered in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting, progression must have occurred 12 months after completion of this treatment.   Prior therapy with radiation for this breast cancer population was permitted if it was administered in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant non metastatic setting. Radiotherapy given in the metastatic setting, prior to initiation of study medication, was allowed to a limited area (e.g., palliative therapy and involving less than 25% of bone marrow), if it was not the sole site of disease. Subjects must have completed radiation treatment and recovered from all acute radiation treatment related toxicities (e.g., bone marrow suppression) prior to commencement of combination treatment.   The subject must have received all prior chemotherapy treatment at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment in this study and must have recovered from all related toxicities. Subjects who have received weekly dose of prior chemotherapy e.g. gemcitabine or capecitabine may enroll 2 to 3 weeks after cessation of treatment provided that they have recovered from all related toxicities.   Prior therapy with trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting was permitted. The subject must have received all prior trastuzumab treatment at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment in this study and must have recovered from all related toxicities.   Prior endocrine therapy was permitted in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant or metastatic setting. The subject must have received all prior endocrine treatment at least 1 week prior to enrollment in this study and must have recovered from all related toxicities.   Prior diagnosis of cancer was allowed as long as the subject was free of disease for 5 years.

Hydrophor application should include the entire treatment area, including the axillae and shoulder/back area in patients treated with modified radical mastectomy. To avoid possible build-up effects, patients should not apply the Hydrophor within 4 hours of receiving RT. Patients should wash the application area daily with perfume-free soap and tap water. Patients will be asked to refrain from using other topical agents in the irradiated area.

It is hoped that the outcome of this pilot study will provide evidence supporting the use of Medihoney in preventing and treating radiation dermatitis as well as sufficient preliminary data to expand this study to larger, federally funded research (R01) looking at the beneficial aspects of Medihoney across a spectrum of radiation dermatitis and mucositis in several disease settings.

Hydrophor application should include the entire treatment area, including the axillae and shoulder/back area in patients treated with modified radical mastectomy. To avoid possible build-up effects, patients should not apply the Hydrophor within 4 hours of receiving RT. Patients should wash the application area daily with perfume-free soap and tap water.

The Vaginal Symptom Measure (VSM) was used to evaluate the severity of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. The VSM uses a 5- point ordinal response scale; 1=""none"", 2=""mild"", 3=""moderate"", 4=""severe"" and 5=""very severe"" to measure the severity associated with vaginal dryness and/or dyspareunia. For each patient, the change in severity was calculated by subtracting the baseline from the week 12 reported score. Therefore, the full range of scores ranges from -4 (greatest decrease in severity) to 4 (greatest increase in severity). A negative score indicates a decrease in severity from baseline, zero indicates no reported affect and positive scores indicate a more severe report at week 12. The primary assessment method will be a comparison of the averages of the changes over time in the severity items for the most bothersome symptom from baseline to 12 weeks (as indicated at baseline).

The Vaginal Symptom Measure (VSM) was used to evaluate the severity of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. The VSM uses a 5- point ordinal response scale; 1=""none"", 2=""mild"", 3=""moderate"", 4=""severe"" and 5=""very severe"" to measure the severity associated with vaginal dryness and/or dyspareunia. For each patient, the change in severity was calculated by subtracting the baseline from the week 12 reported score. Therefore, the full range of scores ranges from -4 (greatest decrease in severity) to 4 (greatest increase in severity). A negative score indicates a decrease in severity from baseline, zero indicates no reported affect and positive scores indicate a more severe report at week 12. The primary assessment method will be a comparison of the averages of the changes over time in the severity items for the most bothersome symptom from baseline to 12 weeks (as indicated at baseline).

The intra-patient difference in hot flash activity between baseline (study week 1) and treatment termination (study week 7) is the primary endpoint. The hot flash activity will be measured by the weekly average hot flash score which is a composite entity of both frequency and severity of hot flashes.   The hot flash severities are graded from 1 to 4, ranging from mild, to moderate, to severe to very severe. The daily hot flash score is computed by multiplying the mean grade of severity by the frequency during every 24 hour period. Therefore, a score of zero is the lowest possible score and can be interpreted as having no hot flashes. The average daily hot flash score during the baseline week was compared to the average daily value during week 7.   The primary method of analysis will be the independent sample t-test to examine the change of weekly average hot flash score from baseline to treatment termination between flaxseed and placebo arms.

FACT-B consists of 5 subscale scores pertaining to 4 well-being dimensions (physical, social-family, emotional, functional) and additional breast cancer concerns. A total overall score is the sum of all subscales. Response options were 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much.   Psychometric analysis in our Spanish-speaking Latina sample resulted in modifications to FACT-B: physical well-being subscale. Of 7 items, 1 was dropped because it was conceptually different from other items on that scale. Modified subscale was scored by summing items. Possible score ranges for physical well-being were 0-24. Higher scores indicated greater well-being.

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.   Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of the study drugs on the developing fetus are unknown.   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with BMN 673. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

The non-inferiority analyses were performed by comparing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the two algorithms & to compare false positive marks per subject.   The ROC curve incorporates both sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) providing a single assessment incorporating both measures. It shows in a graphical way the trade-off between clinical sensitivity and specificity for every possible cut-off for a test, and gives an idea about the benefit of using the test in question. The higher the total area under the curve, the greater the predictive power of the reader assessments.   A breast-based analysis was used for the primary AUC comparison in order to obtain additional power by having more normal/benign breasts.   Time frame: ~1 year. Women with negative or biopsy benign findings at baseline (study entry) were followed for 1 year to confirm the negative status at 1-year follow-up mammography exam. Women diagnosed with cancer were not followed up.

Patients without pathologic or cytologic confirmation of metastatic disease should have unequivocal evidence of metastasis using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.   The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status of the tumor will be used to stratify patients. Tumors that are HER2 FISH+ will receive vinflunine and trastuzumab. Patients with tumors which are HER2 FISH negative or if the HER2 status is unknown/not performed will remain on study and will receive single agent vinflunine.   Patients must have measurable disease not directly irradiated as per RECIST criteria.   Measurable disease- is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm with conventional techniques or as >10 mm with spiral CT scan.   Prior Therapy: Patients must not have received prior chemotherapy in the metastatic breast setting. Patients who have not received prior anthracyclines or taxanes should be considered for these agents. Patients may have received prior chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy for early stage breast cancer. The chemotherapy regimen may have included an anthracycline and/or a taxane as long as it has been > 6 months since completion of the regimen. Adjuvant trastuzumab is allowed. Patients may have received prior radiation therapy in either the metastatic or early stage setting as long as <25% of the bone marrow has been treated. Prior radiation to the whole pelvis is not allowed. Radiation therapy must be completed at least 7 days prior to study registration, and all radiation related toxicities must be resolved to grade  1 before patient is eligible for study inclusion. Patients may have received any number of hormonal therapies in the neo-adjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting.   Age >18 years.   Life expectancy of > 6 months.   Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status <2.   Patients must have normal organ and marrow function. Laboratory tests should be completed within 14 days prior to starting study treatment. Only for patients who will be receiving trastuzumab, a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) may be determined by either echocardiography or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan, and should be obtained within 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment.   Fertility/reproduction. Patients must not be pregnant, expect to become pregnant or conceive a child from time of first signing study consent until at least 12 weeks after last dose of study treatment.   Exclusion Criteria   Patients who have received prior vinca alkaloid chemotherapy are not eligible unless treatment was completed > 5 years ago.   Patients in which the HER2 status is unknown or is FISH negative will not receive trastuzumab but are eligible for treatment with single agent vinflunine.   Patients that have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.   Patients receiving trastuzumab must have received a cumulative dose of doxorubicin less than 360mg/m2, and/or an epirubicin cumulative dose less than 720mg/m2 for study entry.   Patients with known leptomeningeal carcinomatosis are excluded from this clinical trial   History of grade 3 or 4 allergic reactions attributed to trastuzumab.   Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
